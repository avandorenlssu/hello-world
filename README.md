# hello-world

Hello!  I am taking a Data Science course through Coursera, and as a part of the course, I am learning how to use GitHub.

This is not the first experience I've have with GitHub -- I tried to muddle through it when I worked with DPPL but since I had to jump into someone else's Repository without any guidance, it was not easy.
